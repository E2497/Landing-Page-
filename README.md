# Development 

I started with downloading the starter files from GitHub

first step was adding section number 4 then in the app.js file I started selecting sections and looping through to create li and link elements to add to ul in order to create navigation bar then we use add event to link the elements in navigation bar to it's section.

the next thing is to highlight the active section in navigation bar using scroll event and once again you loop through sections and links to add a class to change style to active section.

next step is to add suggested features like hiding navigation bar when the user is not scrolling for too long we do this using (setTimeOut) with scroll eventto check if user scrolled or not.

another feature to add is scroll to top button.

i added the button in the html code and added some *css* class for it and then *js code* to scroll to top.

last thing was making the section collasible i added buttons to each section in *htm*l.

then selected all the button and looped throught to hide or unhide the sibling element after the button in *html*.
